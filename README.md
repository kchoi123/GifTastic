### This is our API Gif assignment. 

###### Created this assignment using the dog breed theme. Prepopulated dog breed names are listed on the right side. When the button is clicked it will take the attribute from the button name to search the giphy URL. The limit is set to 10 and the rating is set to G. Users can add more gif queries by typing in a dog breed at the top text input and selecting submit. This will execute a function that takes the text in the input box and add it to the array of buttons being prepopulated. Users can now select the newly created button to search their query through the assigned giphy API URL that has be created by me, Kevin Choi!

###### Please test it out!
